Meeting 11.25.20


  This week we set out to format the data and start thinking about how we wanted to use it. The first thing we did was write some code to parse through the large data set and pick out the pieces relevant to us. We decided to use each datapoint’s origin and destination subreddits to create vertices/edges. Any repeats would add 1 to the edge weight. Next, we created our graph using the graph class from lab_ml. After that, we made a simple makefile with dependencies. We attempted to use lab_ml’s png output to quickly visualize a small subgraph of our graph, but quickly realized that the function was written for a very different representation of data and stopped there. We concluded with deciding that we would distribute the algorithms among ourselves once we learned a bit more about them in class.

Meeting 12.5.20

  This week, we delegated tasks so that each person had an algorithm to work on. We also realized that since the landmark path algorithm could easily be implemented with two uses of Dijkstra's algorithm, we needed an additional algorithm so that the work could be fairly split. We decided to implement an algorithm that analyzes strongly connected components. For the remainder of the meeting, the four of us worked on our individual tasks. Our goal is to get most of the code written by next meeting, so that any remaining time can be spent finalizing the codebase and creating our video submission.
